# Spotify-Inspired Personal Website — Styling & Layout Spec

## Overall Design Language
- Visual inspiration: Spotify desktop home UI
- Theme: Dark mode only
- Background: Deep charcoal / near-black gradient
- Accent color: Spotify green (#1DB954) for highlights, hovers, and focus states
- Typography:
  - Primary font: Spotify Circular (or closest fallback like Inter / Helvetica)
  - Headings: Bold, large, high letter-spacing
  - Body text: Regular weight, muted gray

The site should feel minimal, modern, and content-first, with subtle motion and hover feedback.
