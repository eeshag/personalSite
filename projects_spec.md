# Projects page— Styling & Layout Spec (Spotify-Inspired)

## Purpose
This page adapts Spotify’s playlist detail view into a long-form “Projects” reading experience.  
The structure, spacing, fonts, and colors should closely mirror the Spotify UI shown in the inspiration image, while replacing music-specific elements with personal content.

## Overall Visual Style
- Theme: Dark mode (same as main site)
- Background: Identical gradient and tones as Spotify playlist pages
- Accent colors: Minimal — focus on text and layout, not decoration
- Typography:
  - Primary font: Spotify Circular (or closest fallback)
  - Headers: Bold, large
  - Metadata text: Small, muted gray

## Top Banner Section (Playlist Header Equivalent)

### Left Square Cover
- Shape: Large square (playlist-cover size)
- Background color: #9333EA
- Centered icon: 👤
- Icon color: White
